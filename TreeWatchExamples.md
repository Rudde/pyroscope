As mentioned on the QueueManager page, commands configured to be executed during item loading can be templates. This can be used to support all sorts of tricks, the most common ones are explained here, including fully dynamic completion moving. If the following explanation of the inner workings is too technical and nerdy for you, skip to the “Examples” section below, and just adapt one of the prepared use cases to your setup.

So how does this work? When a `.torrent` file is notified for loading, it's parsed and contained data is put into variables that can be used in the command templates. In order to get an idea what variables are available, you can dump the templating namespace for a metafile to the console, by calling the `watch` job directly.

Consider this example:
```
$ date >example.dat
$ mktor -q example.dat http://tracker.example.com/
$ python -m pyrocore.torrent.watch -v example.dat.torrent
…
DEBUG    Tree watcher created with config Bunch(active=False, …
    cmd.target='{{# set target path\n}}d.custom.set=targetdir,/var/torrent/done/{{label}}/{{relpath}}',
    dry_run=True, handler='pyrocore.torrent.watch:TreeWatch', job_name='treewatch',
    load_mode='start', path='/var/torrent', queued='True', quiet='False', schedule='hour=*')
DEBUG    custom commands = {'target': <Template 2d01990 name=None>, 'nfo': f.multicall=*.nfo,f.set_priority=2, …}
INFO     Templating values are:
    commands=[…, 'd.custom.set=targetdir,/var/torrent/done//pyrocore', …]
    filetype='.dat'
    …
    info_hash='8D59E3FD8E78CC9896BDE4D65B0DC9BDBA0ADC70'
    info_name='example.dat'
    label=''
    pathname='/var/torrent/pyroscope/example.dat.torrent'
    relpath='pyrocore'
    tracker_alias='tracker.example.com'
    traits=Bunch(kind=None)
    watch_path=set(['/var/torrent'])
```

Things to take note of:
  1. the `target` custom command is expanded to set the `targetdir` rTorrent attribute to the completion path (which can then be used in a typical `event.download.finished` handler), using the `relpath` variable which is obtained from the full `.torrent` path, relative to the watch dir root.
  1. all kinds of other information is made available, like the torrent's info hash and the tracker alias; thus you can write conditional templates based on tracker, or use the tracker name in a completion path.
  1. for certain types of downloads, `traits` provides parsed information to build specific target paths, e.g. for the `Pioneer.One.S01E06.720p.x264-VODO` TV episode, you'll get this:
```
label='tv/mkv'
traits=Bunch(aspect=None, codec='x264', episode='06', extension=None, format='720p', group='VODO', 
    kind='tv', pattern='Normal TV Episodes', release=None, release_tags=None,
    season='01', show='Pioneer.One', sound=None, title=None)
```


# Examples #

## Completion Moving ##
Since the templating namespace automatically includes the path of a loaded `.torrent` file relative to the watch root (in `relpath`, see above example namespace output and the config example further down), you can set the "move on completion" target using that value.

```
job.treewatch.cmd.target    = {{# set target path
    }}d.custom.set=targetdir,/var/torrent/done/{{label}}/{{relpath}}
```
