# Commands #

## mktor ##
```
mktor [options] <dir-or-file> <tracker-url-or-alias>...

Options:
  -p, --private         disallow DHT and PEX
  --no-date             leave out creation date
  -o PATH, --output-filename=PATH
                        optional file name for the metafile
  -r NAME, --root-name=NAME
                        optional root name (default is basename of the data
                        path)
  -x PATTERN [-x ...], --exclude=PATTERN [-x ...]
                        exclude files matching a glob pattern from hashing
  --comment=TEXT        optional human-readable comment
  -X LABEL, --cross-seed=LABEL
                        set explicit label for cross-seeding (changes info
                        hash)
  -H, --hashed, --fast-resume
                        create second metafile containing libtorrent fast-
                        resume information
```

`mktor` creates `*.torrent` files (metafiles), given the path to a file, directory, or named pipe (more on that below) and a tracker URL or alias name (see UserConfiguration on how to define them). Optionally, you can also set an additional comment and a different name for the resulting torrent file. Peer exchange and DHT can be disabled by using the `--private` option.

If you create torrents for different trackers, they're automatically enabled for cross-seeding, i.e. you can load several torrents for exactly the same data into your client. For the technically inclined, this is done by adding a unique key so that the info hash is always different.

To exclude files stored on disk from the resulting torrent, use the `--exclude` option to extend the list of standard glob patterns that are ignored. These standard patterns are: `core`, `CVS`, `.*`, `*~`, `*.swp`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`, `[Tt]humbs.db`, `[Dd]esktop.ini`, and `ehthumbs_vista.db`.

The `--fast-resume` option creates a second metafile `*-resume.torrent` that contains special entries which, when loaded into rTorrent, makes it skip the redundant hashing phase (after all, you hashed the files just now). It is **very** important to upload the _other_ file without `resume` in its name to your tracker, else you cause leechers using rTorrent problems with starting their download.

As a unique feature, if you want to change the root directory of the torrent to something different than the basename of the data directory, you can do so with the `--root-name` option. This is especially useful if you have hierarchical paths like `documents/2009/myproject/specs` - normally, all the context information but `specs` would be lost on the receiving side. Just don't forget to provide a symlink in your download directory with the chosen name that points to the actual data directory.

Very few people will ever need that, but another advanced feature is concurrent hashing â€” if the first argument is a named pipe (see the `mkfifo` man page), the filenames to be hashed are read from that pipe. These names must be relative to the directory the named pipe resides in, or put another way, the named pipe has to be created in the same directory as the files to be hashed. For example, this makes it possible to hash files as they arrive via FTP or are transcoded from one audio format to another, reducing overall latency. See [this bash script](http://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/source/browse/trunk/pyrocore/src/tests/fifotest.sh) for a demonstration of the concept.

## lstor ##
`lstor` lists the contents of bittorrent metafiles. The resulting output looks like this:
```
NAME pavement.torrent
SIZE 3.6 KiB (0 * 32.0 KiB + 3.6 KiB)
HASH 2D1A7E443D23907E5118FA4A1065CCA191D62C0B

```

`lstor` has these options:
```
  --reveal       show full announce URL including keys
  --raw          print the metafile's raw content in all detail
  -V, --skip-validation
                 show broken metafiles with an invalid structure
  --output=KEY,KEY1.KEY2,...
                 select fields to print, output is separated by TABs;
                 note that __file__ is the path to the metafile,
                 __hash__ is the info hash, and __size__ is the data
                 size in byte
```

Starting with v0.3.6, you can select to output specific fields from the metafile, like this:
```
$ lstor -qo __hash__,info.piece\ length,info.name *.torrent
00319ED92914E30C9104DA30BF39AF862513C4C8	262144	Execute My Liberty - The Cursed Way -- Jamendo - OGG Vorbis q7 - 2010.07.29 [www.jamendo.com]
```

And to see a metafile with all the guts hanging out, use the `--raw` option:

## chtor ##
```
Usage: chtor [options] <metafile>...

Change attributes of a bittorrent metafile.

  -n, --dry-run         don't write changes to disk, just tell what would
                        happen
  --no-skip             do not skip broken metafiles that fail the integrity
                        check

  -C, --clean           remove all non-standard data from metafile outside the
                        info dict
  -A, --clean-all       remove all non-standard data from metafile including
                        inside the info dict
  -X, --clean-xseed     like --clean-all, but keep libtorrent resume
                        information
  -R, --clean-rtorrent  remove all rTorrent session data from metafile
  -H DATAPATH, --hashed=DATAPATH, --fast-resume=DATAPATH
                        add libtorrent fast-resume information
  -a URL, --reannounce=URL
                        set a new announce URL, but only if the old announce
                        URL matches the new one
  --reannounce-all=URL  set a new announce URL on ALL given metafiles
  --no-cross-seed       when using --reannounce-all, do not add a non-standard
                        field to the info dict ensuring unique info hashes
  --comment=TEXT        set a new comment (an empty value deletes it)
  --bump-date           set the creation date to right now
  --no-date             remove the 'creation date' field
```

`chtor` is able to change common attributes of a metafile, or clean any non-standard data from them (namely, rTorrent session information).

For `rtorrent`, to mass-change the announce URL for a tracker, you would do this:
  * stop `rtorrent`
  * **make a backup of your `*.torrent` files** (`tar cvfz /tmp/metafiles.tgz ./.session ./watch` or similar)
  * `chtor -a http://example.com/new/announce/url watch/*.torrent .session/*.torrent`
  * restart `rtorrent`

Note that `chtor` automatically changes only those metafiles whose existing announce URL starts with the scheme and location of the new URL (`http://example.com/` in the above example). To change all given metafiles unconditionally, use the `--reannounce-all` option and be very sure you provide only those files you actually want to be changed.

`chtor` only rewrites metafiles that were actually changed, and those changes are first written to a temporary file, which is then renamed.


## rtcontrol ##
`rtcontrol` allows you to select torrents loaded into rTorrent using various filter conditions. You can then either display the matches found in any rTorrent view, list them to the console using flexible output formatting, or perform some management action like starting and stopping torrents.

For example, the command `rtcontrol up=+0 up=-10k` will list all torrents that are currently uploading any data, but at a rate of below 10 KiB/s. See the RtControlExamples page for more real-world examples.


## rtxmlrpc ##
`rtxmlrpc` allows you to call raw XMLRPC methods on the rTorrent instance that you have specified in your configuration. See the [usage information](CliUsage#rtxmlrpc.md) for available options.

The method name and optional arguments are provided using standard shell rules, i.e. where you would use "^X `throttle_down=slow,120`" in rTorrent you just list the arguments in the usual shell way (`rtxmlrpc throttle_down slow 120`). The rTorrent format is also recognized though, but without any escaping rules (i.e. you cannot have a '`,`' in your arguments then).

To get a list of available methods, just call `rtxmlrpc system.listMethods`. See RtXmlRpcExamples for a list of useful calls.


## rtmv ##
```
Usage: rtmv [options] <source>... <target>

Move data actively seeded in rTorrent.

  -n, --dry-run         don't move data, just tell what would happen
  -F, --force-incomplete
                        force a move of incomplete data
```

With `rtmv`, you can move actively seeded data around at will. Currently, it only knows one mode of operation, namely moving the data directory or file and leave a symlink behind in its place (or fixing the symlink if you move data around a second time). Watch this example that shows what's going on internally:
```
~/bt/rtorrent/work$ rtmv lab-rats /tmp/ -v
DEBUG    Found "lab-rats" for 'lab-rats'
INFO     Moving to "/tmp/lab-rats"...
DEBUG    Symlinking "~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats"
DEBUG    rename("~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats", "/tmp/lab-rats")
DEBUG    symlink("/tmp/lab-rats", "~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats")
INFO     Moved 1 path (skipped 0)

$ rtmv /tmp/lab-rats /tmp/lab-mice -v
DEBUG    Item path "~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats" resolved to "/tmp/lab-rats"
DEBUG    Found "lab-rats" for '/tmp/lab-rats'
INFO     Moving to "/tmp/lab-mice"...
DEBUG    Re-linking "~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats"
DEBUG    rename("/tmp/lab-rats", "/tmp/lab-mice")
DEBUG    remove("~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats")
DEBUG    symlink("/tmp/lab-mice", "~/bt/rtorrent/work/lab-rats")
```
From the second example you can see that you can rename actively seeding downloads in mid-flight, i.e. to fix a bad root directory name.

You can use `rtmv` in combination with `rtcontrol` for very flexible completion moving, see [RtControlExamples](RtControlExamples#Move_on_Completion.md) for details. To facilitate this, if there is a double slash `//` in the target path, it is always interpreted as a directory (i.e. you cannot rename the source file in that case), and the partial path after the `//` is automatically created. This can be used in completion moving, to create hierarchies for dynamic paths built from `rtcontrol` fields. Since the part before the `//` has to exist beforehand, this won't go haywire and create directory structures just anywhere.

Future modes of operation will include copying instead of moving, moving and fixing the download directory in rTorrent (like classical rtorrent completion event handling), and moving across devices (i.e. copying and then deleting).

## rtevent ##
`rtevent` handles rTorrent events and provides common implementations for them, like completion moving. See EventHandling for details on using it. **Not yet implemented**
