# Installing the extended rTorrent-PS distribution #
`rTorrent-PS` is an alternative rTorrent executable with some changes to the user interface (colors, one line per torrent display) and other additions, plus stability patches applied. While there is some small interaction with the PyroScope command line tools (especially `rtcontrol`), both things are _independant_.
