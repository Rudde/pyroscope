""" Pylons application test package

    This package assumes the Pylons environment is already loaded, such as
    when this script is imported from the `nosetests --with-pylons=test.ini`
    command.

    This module initializes the application via ``websetup`` (`paster
    setup-app`) and provides the base testing objects.
