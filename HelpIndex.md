## Views ##
PyroScope has the following views:
  * HomeView - Welcome page.

## Browser Compatibility ##
PyroScope is designed for _Mozilla Firefox 3_ and will have no visual defects when used with that browser.

It is also briefly tested with _Internet Explorer 8_ from time to time. Unsurprisingly, there are some CSS problems and no rounded borders, but commonly all features are usable.
