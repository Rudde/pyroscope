WHAT IS IT?

PyroScope is a collection of tools for the BitTorrent protocol and especially the rTorrent client.

This is the core package and basic command line tools subproject.


INSTALLATION

On Ubuntu, do this (tested on Hardy 8.04 LTS):

    sudo aptitude install python-setuptools
    sudo easy_install-2.5 --prefix /usr/local --record /dev/stdout pyrocore

After that, the command line utilities "mktor" and "lstor" should be available in your path.

See the http://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/wiki/QuickStartGuide for more.
