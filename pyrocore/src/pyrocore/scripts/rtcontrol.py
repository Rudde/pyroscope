        Control and inspect rTorrent from the command line.
    
        Filter expressions take the form "<field>=<value>", with the following field 
        names: name, hash, type, tracker, announce, ratio, xfer, down, up, size, age,
        path, realpath, tie.

        All expressions must be met (AND). If a field name is ommitted, "name" is 
        assumed. For numeric fields, a leading "+" means greater than, a leading "-" 
        means less than. For string fields, the value is a glob pattern (*, ?, [a-z]).
        Multiple values separated by a comma indicate several possible choices (OR).
        "!" in front of a filter value negates it.
        
        Examples:
          All 1:1 seeds             ratio=+1
          All active torrents       xfer=+0
          All seeding torrents      up=+0
          Slow torrents             down=+0 down=-5k
          Older than 2 weeks        age=+2w
          Big stuff                 size=+4g
